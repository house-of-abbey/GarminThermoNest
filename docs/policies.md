# Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

## Privacy Policy

### In Short

**_We can't collect your personal data._**<br>
We're not evil.

That's it.

### Longer Version

We can not collect your user data as the software we have written runs client side on your Garmin watch and talks directly to Google Cloud hosting the Nest APIs on a Device Access console.

There is no code authored by us running in Google Cloud, so no logging by us. You are free to [review our source code on GitHub](https://github.com/house-of-abbey/GarminThermoNest) if you have any doubts about how our application operates.

Google wants us to have a YouTube video explaining how we plan to use the Google user data we get from 'scopes'. The scope we have requested is "Smart Device Management API" which is considered sensitive as it allows access to "see and/or control the devices that you selected". That YouTube video cannot exist as it would be empty!

The client software running on your Garmin watch only needs access to your Google Nest products. With this access it will:

* Display the temperature & humidity local to your Nest thermostat, operating modes, available devices. As shown in the [application home page](https://house-of-abbey.github.io/GarminThermoNest/).
* Set the temperature and modes

The software can only work with Google Nest Thermostats, i.e. not cameras! Nor anything else.

You probably need to understand that dependent services have their own privacy policies:

* [Google Cloud Privacy Notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice)
* [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy)

Good luck reading all that lot!

## Terms of Service

### In Short

**We are not liable for anything**, use our software at your own risk.<br>
If in doubt don't use it.<br>
That's it.

### Longer Version

This software is provided AS IS without warranty of any kind.

You probably need to understand that dependent services have their own terms and conditions:

* [Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)
* [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)

Good luck reading all that lot!
